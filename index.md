Course number:
: CIS 121---Spring 2016

Instructor:
: [Rajiv Gandhi](mailto:rajivg100@gmail.com)

Teaching Assistants:
: [Course Staff](staff.html)

Discussion Forum:
: [Piazza](https://piazza.com/upenn/spring2016/cis121/)

Time and place:
: Lectures are Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10:30 in Towne 100

Prerequisites:
: [CIS 120](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/) and CIS 160

Textbook:
: The lectures and readings will be based off of
[Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd edition](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844/).
It is strongly recommended that you buy this textbook for the readings. 

Grading:
: The grading for the course will consist of:

* 55% for homework assignments and the final project
* 10% each for 2 midterm exams
* 20% for the final
* 5% for recitation attendance. Recitation attendance is mandatory.

Late day policy:
: Each student has two free, no-strings-attached late days that they may use on
programming and written homeworks. At the end of the semester, we will arrange
your late day usage so that you will receive the optimal homework average. If
you are out of late days, then you will incur a 25% penalty off the 
total possible number of pointson the homework for
each day late. One "day" here is anywhere between 1 second and 24 hours after
the homework deadline, and a second "day" is between 24 hours and 48 hours after
the homework deadline. For example, An assignment is due on Thursday at 10:30 am. 
You turn it in on Friday at 9:00 am. This would incur a 25 point late penalty 
if the assignment is out of 100 points. 
Late written homeworks can be turned in to Britton
Carnevali in Levine 308. The final project does not have the same late policy;
it has its own late policy, which will be announced with its release.

Collaboration policy for written homeworks:
: You are allowed to discuss solutions to problems in groups of three,
*documenting* who you discussed with at the top of your assignment. You are
allowed to ask anyone for LaTeX help (for instance, "How do I center a stack of
equations?"). You are **not** allowed to write up the solutions together. You
must do that by yourself.

Collaboration policy for programming homeworks:
: You are allowed to discuss low-level issues like the meaning of Java
 constructs, or how to use the computing environment. You are allowed to discuss
 high-level questions such as what the instructor/lab TA said, the content of
 the textbook or other general resources. You **not** allowed to...

-   Discuss issues directly pertaining to the homework questions or
    their solutions.
-   See another students homework solutions, or
-   Show your solutions to another student
    -   This includes asking a classmate to debug your code and agreeing
        to debug a classmate’s code. If you do this during office hours,
        know that the TAs are *required* to report your names to the
        instructor.
-   Share any code except the code that is being made available by us on
    the course website to be used specifically with your solutions
    -   Occasionally, a *small* snippet of code *from the textbook* may help
        your work. You can use such a snippet *with attribution*, i.e.,
        provided you add a comment in which you make clear you copied it
        from the textbook.
    -   You can NOT use snippets of code from the Internet (e.g.,
        StackOverflow.com and similar).
-   Post code on, or use code from, public fora (e.g., GitHub,
    StackOverflow)
-   Look at other people’s information
    -   If you find a terminal on which somebody else has logged in and
        forgot to log out, you *must* log them out
    -   When somebody else is typing a password in front of you *must*
        look out the window, or at your shoes, or at the picture of Brad
        Pitt or Angelina Jolie that you carry on your keychain.
-   Use any code downloaded from the Internet or sent to you by email,
    Facebook, text, Twitter, or even scribbled notes passed from hand to
    hand :)
-   Share the material that we post for this course with anybody who is
    not a registered student in this course or a staff member.
    -   If you find any such material already posted somewhere else you
        *must* inform the course instructor immediately. Same if you are
        contacted by people who offer to solve your homework for money,
        or who knows what else. Use your common sense and ask any member
        of the staff if you are not sure about a resource you are
        considering.

Any violation of the collaboration policy will be dealt with severely.

Regrade policy for programming homeworks:
: We allow you to indicate *small errors* (defined below) that you have made,
    which, when fixed, will allow your programs to pass autograder tests. You
    will need to send an email, by the regrade deadline, which is one week after
    you receive your scores, to
    [cis121-15fa-staff@googlegroups.com](mailto:cis121-16sp-staff@googlegroups.com).
    This email must identify exactly the error in your code and include a
    precise description of the fix that needs to be made. A *small error* is a
    problem whose fix should not require changing more than 1--2 lines of code.
    A TA will make the change and rerun the autograder tests. Your new score
    will be the maximum of your original score and 80% of your regraded score.

Regrade policy for written homeworks and exams:
: Please fill out the
[regrade request form](content/hws/regrade_request_15fa.pdf) and bring it to the
course administrator, Britton Carnevali, in Levin 310, together with the
assignment or exam by the regrade deadline. Regrades are due *one week* after
the assignment or exam has been returned with your score.
